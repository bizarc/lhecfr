## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Julia 1.10 or later
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for full game solving

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lhe_cfr.git
cd lhe_cfr

# Activate the project environment
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

### Running Tests
```bash
julia --project test/runtests.jl
```

### Basic Usage
```julia
using LHECFR

# Build game tree (example - actual implementation may vary)
tree = build_tree()

# Run CFR+ iterations (when implemented)
# strategy = solve_cfr(tree, iterations=1000000)

# Evaluate exploitability (when implemented)
# exploitability = compute_exploitability(tree, strategy)
```

## Implementation Details

### Memory Optimization
The solver uses several techniques to reduce memory usage:
- **Compressed tree storage**: Nodes are stored in memory-efficient formats
- **Integer-based indexing**: Uses dense arrays keyed by integer IDs instead of dictionaries
- **Card isomorphism**: Reduces state space by treating isomorphic card combinations as equivalent
- **Lazy evaluation**: Computes values on-demand where possible

### Card Isomorphism
Advanced card isomorphism is implemented to significantly reduce the state space:
- Suit symmetries are exploited to treat equivalent card combinations as identical
- Canonical representations ensure consistent mapping of isomorphic states
- Supports both preflop and postflop isomorphisms

### Information Sets
Information sets use perfect recall and include:
- Player position
- Current street (preflop, flop, turn, river)
- Betting history (compressed representation)
- Private cards (with isomorphic reduction)
- Public cards (bucketed when applicable)
