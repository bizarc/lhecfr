# Product Requirements Document: Limit Hold'em CFR Solver

## Introduction/Overview

The Limit Hold'em CFR Solver is a comprehensive poker strategy optimization tool designed to identify and teach optimal play in Limit Hold'em poker. Using Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR+) algorithms, this solver will compute Nash equilibrium strategies for poker scenarios, starting with heads-up play and expanding to full-ring games. The primary focus is pre-flop strategy optimization, with progressive expansion to post-flop play (flop, turn, and river).

This tool addresses the need for professional and serious amateur poker players to study optimal strategies, identify exploitable tendencies in opponents, and improve their overall game theory understanding in a simplified, accessible manner.

## Goals

1. **Compute Nash Equilibrium Strategies**: Calculate game-theory optimal (GTO) strategies for Limit Hold'em scenarios with exploitability < 1 mbb/hand
2. **Educational Tool**: Provide clear, understandable strategy outputs for players of all expertise levels
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Support progression from 2-player to 10-player games
4. **Performance Optimization**: Leverage multi-threading, parallel processing, and GPU acceleration for faster solving
5. **Extensibility**: Build foundation for future support of No-Limit variants and other poker games
6. **API-First Design**: Enable integration with external tools and custom applications

## User Stories

1. **As a professional poker player**, I want to compute optimal pre-flop strategies for heads-up Limit Hold'em, so that I can identify and correct leaks in my game.

2. **As a serious amateur player**, I want to visualize hand ranges and decision trees, so that I can understand why certain plays are optimal.

3. **As a poker student**, I want to load and analyze hand histories, so that I can compare my actual play against GTO strategies.

4. **As a coach**, I want to create opponent models based on observed tendencies, so that I can develop exploitative counter-strategies.

5. **As a developer**, I want to access solver functionality through an API, so that I can build custom poker training applications.

6. **As a researcher**, I want to experiment with different abstraction levels and CFR variants, so that I can optimize solving efficiency.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

**Phase 1 (Current) Exclusions:**

- Cloud deployment infrastructure
- Advanced abstraction techniques (initially using minimal abstraction)

## Design Considerations

### User Interface Evolution
- **Phase 1**: Command-line interface with text-based output
- **Phase 2**: Web-based GUI with canvas rendering similar to GTO Wizard
- Consider using Julia's web frameworks (Genie.jl) or separate frontend (React/Vue)
- Visualizations should include:
  - Interactive decision trees
  - Hand range matrices
  - Strategy heatmaps
  - EV distributions

### Data Storage
- Strategies stored in efficient binary format with compression
- Support for strategy versioning and metadata
- Consider using HDF5 or similar for large dataset management

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate solver engine, game logic, UI, and API layers
- **Language**: Julia for performance-critical solver components

## Open Questions

1. **Abstraction Strategy**: What level of card and action abstraction provides the best accuracy/performance tradeoff?
2. **Memory Management**: Should we implement out-of-core solving for very large game trees?
3. **CFR Variants**: Which specific CFR variants (CFR+, Linear CFR, DCFR) should be prioritized?
4. **Opponent Modeling**: What statistical methods should be used for opponent profiling?
5. **API Design**: Should the API be synchronous or support async/webhook patterns for long-running solves?
6. **Visualization Library**: What technology stack for the future GUI (native Julia, web-based, or hybrid)?
7. **Strategy Format**: What standard format should be used for strategy export/import?
8. **Distributed Computing**: Should we support cluster computing or focus on single-machine optimization?
9. **Licensing Model**: Open source, commercial, or hybrid licensing approach?
